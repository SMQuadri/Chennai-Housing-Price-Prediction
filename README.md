# Chennai-Housing-Price-Prediction

This is the very first project i worked upon as part of the Internshala Machine Learning Training. The goal of this project was to predict the price of a given house in Chennai based on the information in the datasets provided by them. This project of mine required the implementation of various data science project fundamentals which helped me to establish my career in the field of data science.
