# Chennai-Housing-Price-Prediction

This is the very first project i worked upon as part of the Internshala Machine Learning Training. The goal of this project was to predict the price of a given house in Chennai based on the information in the datasets provided by them. This project of mine required the implementation of various data science project fundamentals which helped me to establish my career in the field of data science.

Steps involved in this project :
1) Imported the required libraries and the dataset.
2) Performed data analysis and visualization.
3) Found out how various factors (variables) are affecting the target variable i.e; Price of the house by plotting bar plots, histograms & scatter plots.
4) Dataset split into train and test sets using train_test_split.
5) The last step performed was model building.
6) Implemented linear regression model, but it turned out to be a weak prediction model.
7) To overcome this and to attain a high accuracy I used ensemble model.


## Note:
A humble request to the people who came here in search of code for this project, please don't copy the whole code and content. You have spent some time learning this subject. So, better try to write your code in your own way. It will further enhance your skills. If stucked somewhere, this repository is always here to help you.

## Happy Learning !!!
